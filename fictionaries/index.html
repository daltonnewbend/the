            <p>When I met her, she knew I had this power to go back in time with my camera. She&rsquo;d let me have whatever I needed as long as when I went back, I photographed Sigrid. She wanted to see her long flowing dark brown hair and large brown eyes again. The woman was tending a field wearing a pair of overalls and a bandanna.</p>
<p>I parked my truck, out of habit, in my old parking spot. I liked parking a little far away from my door back then just to get a little more exercise in. I walked in to greet Luke where it was cozy and dark. He mentioned something about the others showing up and asked why I parked so far away. There was a lot of snow on the ground, so it could have been dangerous to walk up hill like that. &ldquo;I used to live here, you know?&rdquo; Not in that very apartment, but down in 1007 for about a year, then I moved over to 1195. Luke was somewhere in between, and I had already forgotten. I knew the others would be here soon. The anticipation of swapping gifts was swimming in the air.</p>

            <p>When they&rsquo;d pull up to the mail box, she&rsquo;d come running out from under the pool deck pretending to chase after something. Probably a squirrel. She somehow knew that dogs were supposed to keep guard of the house and keep rodents away. She took after her daddy, I think. Calm and gentle most of the time, but would get real serious when she needed to. You didn&rsquo;t really know what she was thinking half the time because of how stoic she was.
I remember when we got them other dogs, she was not happy. She changed. She knew that they were suddenly more important than her. She kept more quiet most the time, but overall seemed more on edge. She especially didn&rsquo;t like Parker, hardly anyone did. Emmie was fine most of the time, but she started actually killing rodents rather than just chasing them off. Their dad kept voicing concerns about them killing cats, or worse. Even Shelby started killing. She had never done nothing like that before. One time, back by the plum trees, there was something happening. All three of them were growling and making horrible noises, screeching, sounded like something from a horror movie. Once the folks got over there, they saw what was making that horrible noise and why. They&rsquo;d gotten a raccoon.
Later that week it was just back to Shelby. The other dogs had posed too much a risk of rabies, and were a bad influence on her. They taught her how to get outside of the fence, had her killing animals, and overall just made her more on edge. She still wasn&rsquo;t the same. Even more stoic than before, she lived quite quietly after they left. One thing she never forgot was how her Mama would pat the bench that squeaked so loud each time it was hit, she&rsquo;d come from wherever she was and lay down on that bench. She was taught because in the middle of the night, she&rsquo;d start barking at something beyond her fence. Probably an owl or something. So Mama would pat the bench and holler out, &ldquo;Chellllll-burrrrrr,&rdquo; to which she&rsquo;d come running and lay down quietly and go to bed on that bench.</p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s a kind of peace that comes in the autumn. The air smells clearer and feels crisp. Being swallowed up in a quilted duster made just for the wedding, and sipping good pour-over from my #1 DAD mug. Computer stuff is super interesting to me. It&rsquo;s fun to learn how to use the computer as much as possible without picking up the mouse. Of course there&rsquo;s things that still require it, but programs like Obsidian and Neovim make it easier. It&rsquo;s really the browser that is the only thing that makes it hard. Oh and that music player. I need a different one, I think. I&rsquo;m still going through the manual little by little to be sure I don&rsquo;t miss anything. I&rsquo;m eager to get to the configuration part where I can tell this system to open different apps based on the key bindings and somehow get rid of the bullshit I don&rsquo;t want like AI and apps that aren&rsquo;t so much for me.</p>

            <p>When you put the potatoes in the pot, just go ahead and turn it on high. You’re just boiling them, they ain’t gon’ burn. You need some salt and sometimes I’ll go ahead and throw in some pepper.<br>
Now you don’t have to sit here and watch it or play with it. Just let it boil for a while and come back to check on ‘em. You can tell they’re done when you stick a knife in and if it falls right back into the water.<br>
After they’re finished, pour off most the water and just start mashin’. Once they all are a little mashed, throw in your butter, some more black pepper, and just keep going ‘til they just as creamy as you like it.<br>
I don’t always fix gravy, usually only when I make pork chops or something like that. I pour a little broth in the pan to deglaze it, then I start puttin’ my flour in. Sometimes I’ll use cornstarch if that’s all I have, but whatchu don’t wanna do is use biscuit flour. That’ll make it taste too salty. I let the flour cook until it starts turning brown, then I add the rest of my broth or milk or whatever I’m usin’ that night.</p>

            <p>My heart&rsquo;s been racing all morning. Will my makeup run, is my hair straightened, is there a uniform or dress code I don&rsquo;t know about? I haven&rsquo;t had a job job before. This place feels sterile and cold, unlike the Piggly Wiggly where I&rsquo;m always seeing somebody I know.
My boss walked into the room with a big grin on her face, sayin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s good to see me. She asked if I believed any of that stuff about the computers all not working. I told her I didn&rsquo;t know and I reckon we&rsquo;d just have to see.</p>
