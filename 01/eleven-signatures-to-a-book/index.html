<p>Today I&rsquo;ll get to see him again. I asked if I could draw his body hair, something I was doing with mine in my studio. The body&rsquo;s self adornments drawings are a reflection of intimacy. For myself, it marked some key moments where I began feeling confident in my skin and with the person I see in the mirror. The confidence stirred arousal, which in tern stirred more confidence. Intimacy with Will builds even more confidence. His verbal admirations make me grin and give warmth and content. I&rsquo;m interested in learning about his body&rsquo;s adornments and more about his person. Comfort, intimacy, contentment, solace, contact, satiety, climax, ease.

<h6 id="16-feb-2025">16 FEB 2025<a href="#16-feb-2025" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>Two full seasons into this move, the landscape teaches me as much about myself as it does this place. Again I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with someone and it consumes my thoughts throughout the course of each day. My journal throughout October picked up my helplessness and euphoria with this place and this person. He floods my thoughts, my dreams, and my desires. The Tangerine Boy.
I made a book that I think of as his. I asked if I could draw his body hair, which I intend to document in this new pad. The cover comes from an old back of rivets and has illustrations of how the rivets could be used. I&rsquo;m unsure why I feel so attracted to old packaging like these. The illustrations are beautiful and charming. The book has eleven signatures, a happenstance number that correlates to one of the talismans I gave Will.
I sat down this morning to transfer my journal entries over to this platform. I thought I had done this before, and I&rsquo;m still not quite sure if I have. It seemed time, though, given Will and I have broken all the barriers that weighed on me. I feel more free now. Re-reading these notes as I transferred them, I was reminded of feelings and thoughts, and I had thoughts on my own writings. I found it interesting that all of these entries were written prior to our kiss in November. It seemed that once we kissed, I stopped feeling the need to get my thoughts out in this way. You can hear it in my voice, I&rsquo;m yearning to touch him and kiss him. I want my anxiety to be squashed. I want to give in.
At this point, the wall, I feel, is mere rubble. I&rsquo;ve given up caring what people might assume is happening between us, but I&rsquo;m stern in that we should nor affirm or confirm anything with anyone. He seems content with that. It&rsquo;s clear things between us are changing. Settling and building momentum. I still feel deranged by his smell. It&rsquo;s gentle and sweet like an older book. Touching him feels so effortless, and he can sense that. Birding is likely to take a back seat while the weather is too wet and too cold to go out. I miss it, but I&rsquo;m thankful for the seasonal shifts. Without them, we couldn&rsquo;t have the time to make such intimate moments possible.</p>
<h6 id="19-oct-2024">19 OCT 2024<a href="#19-oct-2024" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d escape the sweltering Georgian heat in Connecticut but then I met the tangerine boy. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate or expect for there to be so many butterflies in this state. After a day of lone birding, I felt what could only be described as a gratitude attack. He reminded me of our Wednesday adventure with the bittern. He showed me how to see his posts on eBird, where I saw mention of me. The attack in Will&rsquo;s words was &ldquo;the exquisite pleasure of being known.&rdquo; I still can&rsquo;t comprehend what makes him think I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s too smart for the other. The guy is brilliantly rich with knowledge, vocabulary, and curiosity. Lord help me manage these things, feelings, and desires.</p>
<h6 id="16-oct-2024">16 OCT 2024<a href="#16-oct-2024" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>That feeling of drifting comes over again. Emotion breezing through like these autumn leaves. Collecting on the ground waiting to be converted to food for the trees that grew them.
The birder shares delights with me, grinning ear to ear with hopes to hold my hand and kiss my cheek. Terrified, I&rsquo;ve walled up just north of the friend-zone, keeping just enough distance to steer clear of ethics problems related to our societal positions. I imagine often of the day we&rsquo;re in the same bucket and our hands can finally pass through that final bubble.
All the tings I can&rsquo;t say to him now, how deranged I feel smelling him when he opens his arms for a hug. How his hair should be combed by my hands each time we meet. How his brilliant mind drives me to tough myself wishing it were his hands. The interest he carries for the world is remarkable and joyful. In some ways, it could be his youth.
When he laid on my lap at Higbey, it took patience, the kind the preacher preaches, to not lean down and kiss him.</p>
<h6 id="19-oct-2024-1">19 OCT 2024<a href="#19-oct-2024-1" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>How was it that I was able to say no to a kiss from the citrus? I worry less about the social standing now and worry more about letting him down. A kiss would cause world-colliding energy to rocket and shake our bodies. The Tangerine Boy on my shoulders plucking momiji from the red maple sank my heart further into my chest. When will I kiss the Tangerine Boy? When will I stop caring about that prohibition?
Fixing the color of the momiji, fixing the adventures in our minds.
His willingness to challenge his understanding of a relationship for the sake of a kiss on the cheek, and to express only joy and not being let down, he seems free. The wall between us is all mine. I don&rsquo;t want it, yet I still hold it. Is it it that plausible that our companionship could end my role with the cardinals? He makes a serious point in the dismissing my assumptuous fears. Regardless of the prohibition, two peers, adult peers, should feel free to be an enrichment to each other&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<h6 id="20-oct-2024">20 OCT 2024<a href="#20-oct-2024" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how the abdomen tenses up as the body gets closer &amp; closer to climax? The phallus swells so much, it could almost explode. Once it&rsquo;s finally time to cum, the body begins thrashing about like a fish if we don&rsquo;t hold ourselves back. The jay falls fully slack, and when finish a smirk or grin wipes across the face.
The brain looses out when the body experiences orgasm. In fact, for some it can be a losing battle once the body wants climax bad enough.
I think of what it&rsquo;d be like to hold the Tangerine Boy in my lap as I kiss him and stroke him. Would he thrash about? Would he become mesmerized in the way I do? Bringing him to climax would twist our minds together more than they already are. Is that something we&rsquo;re both prepared for?</p>
<h6 id="21-oct-2024">21 OCT 2024<a href="#21-oct-2024" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>The narrative I&rsquo;m caught up in isn&rsquo;t fair to Will. I thought I&rsquo;d be healed from the constant anxiety I felt when in the closet, but it&rsquo;s back , testing me. He&rsquo;s quite wise &amp; could see that the anxiety is rooted in our sexualities and building a relationship. Worrying about the assumptions people might, or will, make. I can&rsquo;t be preoccupied by that, or it just sours any moments I could spend being fully present with him. He &amp; I should talk again. I need to allow myself to trust him. He&rsquo;s wise, emotionally mature, and is willing to make things work. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll just let him read these notes and lay it all out to him. Reading this also avoids the nagging paranoia of surveillance, because it&rsquo;s quite private. The paranoia may never cease, but I&rsquo;m going to have to work through it to make things fair.</p>
<h6 id="24-oct-2024">24 OCT 2024<a href="#24-oct-2024" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>I let out a sigh of relief knowing he misses me, knowing the feeling is mutual. I hope to see him soon. I&rsquo;m dying to see him.
I finally spoke to Joshua about my feelings toward Will. I had a lot of fear that my feelings for him would give Joshua the wrong idea, that it changes my love for him. Joshua says we&rsquo;ve had this conversation before, and that I don&rsquo;t have to stress myself out or miss out on enjoying my time with someone because I&rsquo;m afraid of catching feelings. Now that I&rsquo;m writing this, I recall him telling me this before and writing how appreciative I am of his understanding and his openness to me having these feelings.
I feel much more at peace now, and feel more okay to wait on intimacy with Will. I still plan to talk to him &amp; let him know I&rsquo;ve been transparent with Joshua. I want him to know the romantic feelings are mutual.
Not knowing how to use this word as a verb or a noun, I can only say kuzusu of that emotional wall is in fact being achieved.</p>
<h6 id="31-oct-2024">31 OCT 2024<a href="#31-oct-2024" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<p>Yesterday I began the morning sitting at Will&rsquo;s desk as he slept. I re-read my journal to try and contextulize what I was doing there. After which, I read some of his sources for school, drew the bed, and a figurine he burns incense from. I was fascinated by how much he disappeared under his sheets. He&rsquo;s a lot tinier that I can actually imagine. Once he woke, we chatted and I showed him the finished pawpaw crown. Spending time with him in such an intimate way is strange. The freeness of his spirit calms my anxiety related to that rule. I&rsquo;m trusting him more each time, and feel more free to express my thoughts and urges. For instance, I want to rub his head, fingers through his hair, as though I&rsquo;m starving.
Once we made it to my place, we both agreed that he needed a garment, so as I do when I get excited about someone, I made him an almost-fully-fleshed-out cape. We used the fabric we kept calling the Handsome Will. A twill checkered fabric that is loaded with autumnal energy. Lined with navy linen &amp; under the collar, cheater cloth, I about cried seeing how happy he was with the piece. I felt as though I sewed part of my soul into the cloth and sent it home with him. His comforting nature helps remove, or rather, work through the anxiety I&rsquo;ve been dealing with regarding the relationship we&rsquo;re building.
His invitation to experience his Big Day coated me in warmth. I couldn&rsquo;t help but fantasize that we&rsquo;d go through his day and conclude by making love.
Re-thinking sharing my notes with him, I feel I can communicate my feelings through my actions. Maybe I will wait to share some for after he graduates. I just fear acknowledging his youth can come off as insulting. As wise as he is, though, I&rsquo;m sure he will understand the journalistic though process behind it.
Last night I dreamt he and I finally kissed and I wish it were true.</p>
