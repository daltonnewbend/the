<meta name="description" content="We&rsquo;ve been in Connecticut for just over a week now. Settling in has definitely had its stressful moments, but overall the move has been smooth. Our friends Ainsley and Gena arrived last Saturday to help us get the bulk of unpacking done. All four of us have moved within the last three months. On Thursday we visited Wesleyan&rsquo;s campus, where I&rsquo;ll be working for the next eight or so months. Hopefully there&rsquo;s a path for me to keep working there more long term, given I don&rsquo;t get worn out by the hour-long commute in my &lsquo;02 Tacoma each day. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the arts buildings spit brutalism in your face. A nice feature of the buildings is most a connected via an underground tunnel. Moreover, my supervisor, Kate, is super pleasant and excited to work with me just as much as I am her. Before we know it, Joshua will be starting his classes. I know he&rsquo;s excited, but he is even more excited to have a studio with lots and lots of studio time. His work lately has been insanely curious and wills me to study things I hadn&rsquo;t considered before. This new wave of interest he&rsquo;s had is full of gumption and typical Joshua spirit, and it makes me oh so eager to see his upcoming journey. Leaving Georgia was quite a tough decision, but every step of the way, not a single doubt took root. We both feel in our hearts that this was the best decision for us and we are both just content to be together in this new place. I told Joshua on Thursday, on the way back from Middletown, I was so scared I would feel a hole leaving our friends back in Georgia, but in fact I&rsquo;ve found that the love we all have for each other is so strong, that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. The hole I was worried about is overflowing with love, and I&rsquo;m ready to fill it with more with new friends here in Connecticut.
