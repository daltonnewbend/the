            <p>He&rsquo;s back and I&rsquo;m already having feelings of missing out. He&rsquo;s looking at a Fork-tailed Flycatcher down in New Haven. I kinda wish I had gone. The bird is cool, it would&rsquo;ve been even cooler to see him. He also tried for the Anhinga yesterday, it&rsquo;s also back. I want to be around his excitement for the birds again. I want his endless information dump. I want his contagious curiosity.
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll see him again someday, I&rsquo;m just not sure when. It&rsquo;s clear Joshua hates him and the thought of him now.
I feel like a part of me is missing or empty knowing he&rsquo;s so close and moving through life. I wonder what he&rsquo;s feeling. I wonder what drives him to seek out the birds.
It seems love drives my curiosity.</p>

<p>fuck- i remember, i remember that first day Will took me out. I remember thinking I kinda knew some birds but had no idea the vastness of the world of birding. I remember telling him a bird made a certain call that was absolutely wrong and he just nodded and let it go. He was so patient and I could tell, even then, that he knew I had no idea what I was getting myself into. He could sense that there was something in me that would latch on and figure it out. Here I am at the first sip of my inaugural New England Summer. Will is moving on and I&rsquo;ve been having a hard time with that. I&rsquo;ve actually been dealing with a lot of rough emotions around him, but I&rsquo;m starting to have peace with it. I wish so much that I could spend more time with him. I wish I could see him as often as I do for the foreseeable future, but I can&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re at two different places in life.
But I&rsquo;m a birder now. I&rsquo;m a birder thanks to him, but also thanks to my crazy autistic brain. I get so excited by these creatures marching and fluttering around outside. They&rsquo;re dumb, they&rsquo;re sweet, they&rsquo;re sometimes pretty annoying, but they&rsquo;re beautiful. It&rsquo;s lovely to have so many reasons to go outside. I can&rsquo;t believe I rushed Annie out of my house because I wanted to go to Mansfield Hollow before twilight was over. I should mention that, of course, she was invited, but she had things to take care of.
I&rsquo;m beginning to not just recognize birds by sight, song, call, and name, but people in the birding community too. I&rsquo;m learning names of people who frequent the eBird reports in Connecticut. I&rsquo;ve met three other prominent birders around my age and one lovely gentleman who showed Will and I where the West Virginia Whites were. I&rsquo;ve even made pals with <em>the</em> David Mathieu. Which I have to admit, I had no idea how much of a celebrity he was until after I began birding with him. I&rsquo;ll have to tell him sometime about my naive self emailing him and Aiden Kiley on the fly asking to bird together. I&rsquo;m so thankful David replied, I feel we click and I feel we could get to become good pals. I&rsquo;d like to invite him to a yard party when we have one this summer. Invite him to see some art or other non-birding things. I wonder what his life is like outside of birding. I wondered that about Will for a while, but I slowly learned that, other than school, he spends much of his private time surfing the naturalist web.
I&rsquo;ll be eternally grateful for Will for giving me almost an entire year of teaching. Without him, I would have never gotten to the point I am at such a swift pace. It was around this time last year I was wishing I could identify birds the way I can now. I remember <a href="07.the-papers/content/01/the%20chattahoochee%20valley%20beats%20like%20a%20heart.md">the chattahoochee valley beats like a heart</a> and hearing all the birds. I <em>was</em> the whippoorwill, after all.. I remember being in California wishing I were a birder because I&rsquo;d be in heaven. It was just a year ago and I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been just a year. I&rsquo;m actually a birder now, and I can honestly say I haven&rsquo;t been so happy in such a long time.</p>

            <p>The little house sparrows keep oscillating from the bush out front to the ledge of the roof. Occasionally their wings all flutter at the same moment resulting in a sound that almost resembles sudden rainfall.
The coffee was pretty good this morning, I quite like the one I got from the local co-op.
&hellip;
&hellip;
It sure is busy this morning.
I spoke with Ainsley on Facetime for what started out as a conversation about hollandaise sauce. I haven&rsquo;t got a clue how to make it, but I&rsquo;ve substituted with a mixture of mayonnaise, mustard, and vinegar a few times. We chatted about plants, settling into our new spaces and places. I was reminded about the similarities here with home, but also the differences.
Its neat how close these birds are.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          
            <p>We&rsquo;ve been in Connecticut for just over a week now. Settling in has definitely had its stressful moments, but  overall the move has been smooth. Our friends Ainsley and Gena arrived last Saturday to help us get the bulk of unpacking done. All four of us have moved within the last three months.
On Thursday we visited Wesleyan&rsquo;s campus, where I&rsquo;ll be working for the next eight or so months. Hopefully there&rsquo;s a path for me to keep working there more long term, given I don&rsquo;t get worn out by the hour-long commute in my &lsquo;02 Tacoma each day. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the arts buildings spit brutalism in your face. A nice feature of the buildings is most a connected via an underground tunnel. Moreover, my supervisor, Kate, is super pleasant and excited to work with me just as much as I am her.
Before we know it, Joshua will be starting his classes. I know he&rsquo;s excited, but he is even more excited to have a studio with lots and lots of studio time. His work lately has been insanely curious and wills me to study things I hadn&rsquo;t considered before. This new wave of interest he&rsquo;s had is full of gumption and typical Joshua spirit, and it makes me oh so eager to see his upcoming journey.
Leaving Georgia was quite a tough decision, but every step of the way, not a single doubt took root. We both feel in our hearts that this was the best decision for us and we are both just content to be together in this new place. I told Joshua on Thursday, on the way back from Middletown, I was so scared I would feel a hole leaving our friends back in Georgia, but in fact I&rsquo;ve found that the love we all have for each other is so strong, that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. The hole I was worried about is overflowing with love, and I&rsquo;m ready to fill it with more with new friends here in Connecticut.</p>
