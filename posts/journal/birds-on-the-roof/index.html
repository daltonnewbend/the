<h1>birds on the roof</h1>

Sep 14, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>The little house sparrows keep oscillating from the bush out front to the ledge of the roof. Occasionally their wings all flutter at the same moment resulting in a sound that almost resembles sudden rainfall.
The coffee was pretty good this morning, I quite like the one I got from the local co-op.</p>
<p>&hellip;
&hellip;
It sure is busy this morning.
I spoke with Ainsley on Facetime for what started out as a conversation about hollandaise sauce. I haven&rsquo;t got a clue how to make it, but I&rsquo;ve substituted with a mixture of mayonnaise, mustard, and vinegar a few times. We chatted about plants, settling into our new spaces and places. I was reminded about the similarities here with home, but also the differences.
Its neat how close these birds are.</p>
<p>Why is it that we can&rsquo;t oscillate from the bush to the roof like birds on the roof. We can&rsquo;t be in two places at once, but we can enjoy the sun as it lights different spaces. We can accept the peace and serenity that comes with diversity.</p>
