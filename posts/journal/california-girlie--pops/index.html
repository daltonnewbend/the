<br/><br/>
<p>Today the girlies and I are on the way out to California. Five of us are meeting in Fresno to drive out to an accommodation just between Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and the Giant Sequoias. We&rsquo;re all super excited to experience these monuments together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s particularly special because these are some of our closest friends, and it&rsquo;ll be one of the last big things we get to do together while we all live in Georgia.
Joshua planned the whole thing, the way he does. I&rsquo;m so grateful he&rsquo;s headstrong about planning, because I am not. I want it all to just happen and enjoy the ride. He&rsquo;s so excited for this trip; he&rsquo;s bought binoculars, a harness, a new flashlight, new boots, jackets, the whole get-up. Of course, everything that can be is in the color green.
I&rsquo;ve packed a notebook I made especially for the month of May in addition to my regular sketchbook. I aim to take both out to the parks each day and have study time. I think I speak for most of us when I say we <i>need</i> time to sit and draw and write. A professor of ours always says, &ldquo;Writing is thinking.&rdquo; Like most, I didn&rsquo;t quite get the advice until I had sat with it and experienced it for myself. Writing <i>is</i> thinking, but drawing is too. As visual artists, we all need the time to sketch ideas, jot notes, and study the world by translating it to paper.
I&rsquo;ll end with a poem I wrote for someone on the trip. Their birthday was yesterday.</p>
<ul><i>
ardent instinct, namely sharp language, ensonorous yen.<br>
free as yon river, ever-nesting endeavors.<br>
so tend each edition, value eclipsed suns.
</i></ul>
