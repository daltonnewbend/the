<h1>sigrid</h1>

<br/><br/>
<p>When I met her, she knew I had this power to go back in time with my camera. She&rsquo;d let me have whatever I needed as long as when I went back, I photographed Sigrid.</p>
<p>She wanted to see her long flowing dark brown hair and large brown eyes again. The woman was tending a field wearing a pair of overalls and a bandanna.</p>
<p>I parked my truck, out of habit, in my old parking spot. I liked parking a little far away from my door back then just to get a little more exercise in. I walked in to greet Luke where it was cozy and dark. He mentioned something about the others showing up and asked why I parked so far away. There was a lot of snow on the ground, so it could have been dangerous to walk up hill like that. &ldquo;I used to live here, you know?&rdquo; Not in that very apartment, but down in 1007 for about a year, then I moved over to 1195. Luke was somewhere in between, and I had already forgotten. I knew the others would be here soon. The anticipation of swapping gifts was swimming in the air.</p>
