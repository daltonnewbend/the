<p>fuck- i remember, i remember that first day Will took me out. I remember thinking I kinda knew some birds but had no idea the vastness of the world of birding. I remember telling him a bird made a certain call that was absolutely wrong and he just nodded and let it go. He was so patient and I could tell, even then, that he knew I had no idea what I was getting myself into. He could sense that there was something in me that would latch on and figure it out. Here I am at the first sip of my inaugural New England Summer. Will is moving on and I&rsquo;ve been having a hard time with that. I&rsquo;ve actually been dealing with a lot of rough emotions around him, but I&rsquo;m starting to have peace with it. I wish so much that I could spend more time with him. I wish I could see him as often as I do for the foreseeable future, but I can&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re at two different places in life.
But I&rsquo;m a birder now. I&rsquo;m a birder thanks to him, but also thanks to my crazy autistic brain. I get so excited by these creatures marching and fluttering around outside. They&rsquo;re dumb, they&rsquo;re sweet, they&rsquo;re sometimes pretty annoying, but they&rsquo;re beautiful. It&rsquo;s lovely to have so many reasons to go outside. I can&rsquo;t believe I rushed Annie out of my house because I wanted to go to Mansfield Hollow before twilight was over. I should mention that, of course, she was invited, but she had things to take care of.
I&rsquo;m beginning to not just recognize birds by sight, song, call, and name, but people in the birding community too. I&rsquo;m learning names of people who frequent the eBird reports in Connecticut. I&rsquo;ve met three other prominent birders around my age and one lovely gentleman who showed Will and I where the West Virginia Whites were. I&rsquo;ve even made pals with <em>the</em> David Mathieu. Which I have to admit, I had no idea how much of a celebrity he was until after I began birding with him. I&rsquo;ll have to tell him sometime about my naive self emailing him and Aiden Kiley on the fly asking to bird together. I&rsquo;m so thankful David replied, I feel we click and I feel we could get to become good pals. I&rsquo;d like to invite him to a yard party when we have one this summer. Invite him to see some art or other non-birding things. I wonder what his life is like outside of birding. I wondered that about Will for a while, but I slowly learned that, other than school, he spends much of his private time surfing the naturalist web.
I&rsquo;ll be eternally grateful for Will for giving me almost an entire year of teaching. Without him, I would have never gotten to the point I am at such a swift pace. It was around this time last year I was wishing I could identify birds the way I can now. I remember <a href="07.the-papers/content/01/the%20chattahoochee%20valley%20beats%20like%20a%20heart.md">the chattahoochee valley beats like a heart</a> and hearing all the birds. I <em>was</em> the whippoorwill, after all.. I remember being in California wishing I were a birder because I&rsquo;d be in heaven. It was just a year ago and I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been just a year. I&rsquo;m actually a birder now, and I can honestly say I haven&rsquo;t been so happy in such a long time.</p>
