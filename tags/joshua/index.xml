Five of us are meeting in Fresno to drive out to an accommodation just between Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and the Giant Sequoias. We&amp;rsquo;re all super excited to experience these monuments together. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly special because these are some of our closest friends, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the last big things we get to do together while we all live in Georgia.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;joshua-planned-the-whole-thing-the-way-he-does-im-so-grateful-hes-headstrong-about-planning-because-i-am-not-i-want-it-all-to-just-happen-and-enjoy-the-ride-hes-so-excited-for-this-trip-hes-bought-binoculars-a-harness-a-new-flashlight-new-boots-jackets-the-whole-get-up-of-course-everything-that-can-be-is-in-the-color-green&#34;&gt;Joshua planned the whole thing, the way he does. I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful he&amp;rsquo;s headstrong about planning, because I am not. I want it all to just happen and enjoy the ride. He&amp;rsquo;s so excited for this trip; he&amp;rsquo;s bought binoculars, a harness, a new flashlight, new boots, jackets, the whole get-up. Of course, everything that can be is in the color green.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;ive-packed-a-notebook-i-made-especially-for-the-month-of-may-in-addition-to-my-regular-sketchbook-i-aim-to-take-both-out-to-the-parks-each-day-and-have-study-time-i-think-i-speak-for-most-of-us-when-i-say-we-need-time-to-sit-and-draw-and-write-a-professor-of-ours-always-says-writing-is-thinking-like-most-i-didnt-quite-get-the-advice-until-i-had-sat-with-it-and-experienced-it-for-myself-writing-is-thinking-but-drawing-is-too-as-visual-artists-we-all-need-the-time-to-sketch-ideas-jot-notes-and-study-the-world-by-translating-it-to-paper&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve packed a notebook I made especially for the month of May in addition to my regular sketchbook. I aim to take both out to the parks each day and have study time. I think I speak for most of us when I say we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; time to sit and draw and write. A professor of ours always says, &amp;ldquo;Writing is thinking.&amp;rdquo; Like most, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get the advice until I had sat with it and experienced it for myself. Writing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; thinking, but drawing is too. As visual artists, we all need the time to sketch ideas, jot notes, and study the world by translating it to paper.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;ill-end-with-a-poem-i-wrote-for-someone-on-the-trip-their-birthday-was-yesterday&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll end with a poem I wrote for someone on the trip. Their birthday was yesterday.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#xA;ardent instinct, namely sharp language, ensonorous yen.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;free as yon river, ever-nesting endeavors.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;so tend each edition, value eclipsed suns.&#xA;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
