A lot of gratitude for the experiences I&amp;rsquo;m earning. Eddie talked about &lt;i&gt;viberations&lt;/i&gt;, but that feels &lt;em&gt;too loud&lt;/em&gt;. Butch&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;intertwanglism&lt;/i&gt; is too culturally specific. Both were onto something though. When you begin to see it, you can&amp;rsquo;t unsee it. &lt;i&gt;The Egg&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;Universe&lt;/b&gt;, yada yada, yes- &lt;b&gt;BUT&lt;/b&gt;. Magic, spirits, living earth. There&amp;rsquo;s something &lt;em&gt;OUT THERE&lt;/EM&gt;. And yesterday I &lt;u&gt;felt&lt;/u&gt; it. Felt? Today I &lt;u&gt;SAW&lt;/u&gt; it. But looks and feels are quite different in this place. A visual version of the &lt;i&gt;Realm of Sonorous Being&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;what-is-all-of-this&#34;&gt;What is all of this?&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The snow made me very happy. I was elated we got to experience the park in this &amp;lsquo;&lt;i&gt;off season&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo; way.&#xA;Being is fun. Existing is rewarding.&#xA;All these questions make me happy.&#xA;The gratitude grows. I&amp;rsquo;m finding myself being grateful for the pain, fear, and anxiety as much as the awe, the love, and the pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;california-girlie-pops&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;california girlie-pops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;today-the-girlies-and-i-are-on-the-way-out-to-california-five-of-us-are-meeting-in-fresno-to-drive-out-to-an-accommodation-just-between-yosemite-kings-canyon-and-the-giant-sequoias-were-all-super-excited-to-experience-these-monuments-together-its-particularly-special-because-these-are-some-of-our-closest-friends-and-itll-be-one-of-the-last-big-things-we-get-to-do-together-while-we-all-live-in-georgia&#34;&gt;Today the girlies and I are on the way out to California. Five of us are meeting in Fresno to drive out to an accommodation just between Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and the Giant Sequoias. We&amp;rsquo;re all super excited to experience these monuments together. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly special because these are some of our closest friends, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the last big things we get to do together while we all live in Georgia.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;joshua-planned-the-whole-thing-the-way-he-does-im-so-grateful-hes-headstrong-about-planning-because-i-am-not-i-want-it-all-to-just-happen-and-enjoy-the-ride-hes-so-excited-for-this-trip-hes-bought-binoculars-a-harness-a-new-flashlight-new-boots-jackets-the-whole-get-up-of-course-everything-that-can-be-is-in-the-color-green&#34;&gt;Joshua planned the whole thing, the way he does. I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful he&amp;rsquo;s headstrong about planning, because I am not. I want it all to just happen and enjoy the ride. He&amp;rsquo;s so excited for this trip; he&amp;rsquo;s bought binoculars, a harness, a new flashlight, new boots, jackets, the whole get-up. Of course, everything that can be is in the color green.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;ive-packed-a-notebook-i-made-especially-for-the-month-of-may-in-addition-to-my-regular-sketchbook-i-aim-to-take-both-out-to-the-parks-each-day-and-have-study-time-i-think-i-speak-for-most-of-us-when-i-say-we-need-time-to-sit-and-draw-and-write-a-professor-of-ours-always-says-writing-is-thinking-like-most-i-didnt-quite-get-the-advice-until-i-had-sat-with-it-and-experienced-it-for-myself-writing-is-thinking-but-drawing-is-too-as-visual-artists-we-all-need-the-time-to-sketch-ideas-jot-notes-and-study-the-world-by-translating-it-to-paper&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve packed a notebook I made especially for the month of May in addition to my regular sketchbook. I aim to take both out to the parks each day and have study time. I think I speak for most of us when I say we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; time to sit and draw and write. A professor of ours always says, &amp;ldquo;Writing is thinking.&amp;rdquo; Like most, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get the advice until I had sat with it and experienced it for myself. Writing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; thinking, but drawing is too. As visual artists, we all need the time to sketch ideas, jot notes, and study the world by translating it to paper.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;ill-end-with-a-poem-i-wrote-for-someone-on-the-trip-their-birthday-was-yesterday&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll end with a poem I wrote for someone on the trip. Their birthday was yesterday.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#xA;ardent instinct, namely sharp language, ensonorous yen.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;free as yon river, ever-nesting endeavors.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;so tend each edition, value eclipsed suns.&#xA;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
