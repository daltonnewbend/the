      <description>&lt;p&gt;The little house sparrows keep oscillating from the bush out front to the ledge of the roof. Occasionally their wings all flutter at the same moment resulting in a sound that almost resembles sudden rainfall.&#xA;The coffee was pretty good this morning, I quite like the one I got from the local co-op.&#xA;&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;&#xA;It sure is busy this morning.&#xA;I spoke with Ainsley on Facetime for what started out as a conversation about hollandaise sauce. I haven&amp;rsquo;t got a clue how to make it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve substituted with a mixture of mayonnaise, mustard, and vinegar a few times. We chatted about plants, settling into our new spaces and places. I was reminded about the similarities here with home, but also the differences.&#xA;Its neat how close these birds are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>a cool late-summer morning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a cool late-summer morning, a sunday, and I&amp;rsquo;m sipping on my coffee that tastes like Columbus, Georgia. Having the windows open first thing in the morning is quite a treat, and I sadly anticipate the time of year this won&amp;rsquo;t be available.&#xA;Each morning I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to start the day off with mindfulness and body awareness. A breif meditation session followed by a radio taiso routine, sometimes I throw in some extra hamstring stretches at the end. This morning, I felt compelled to right for a bit before me and my new neighbor and friend, Annie, go for a run. It&amp;rsquo;s been nagging at be all year, this compulsion to write. The compulsion to read has be gnawing at my left ear just as much. Having treated myself to this new computer with this thocky keyboard, writing is just like eating a boston cream donut at the Brimfield Flea Market. That donut yesterday was something special. I&amp;rsquo;ve never in my life had a boston cream that rendered me speechless.&#xA;Joshua being in grad school means he&amp;rsquo;s got a lot to read, and one of those things is Bird by Bird by Anne Larmotte. She&amp;rsquo;s a writer, obviously, but also a writing coach. Bird by Bird is Lamotte&amp;rsquo;s advice column of a paperback on how to be a better, and more fulfilled writer. Her advice is exactly what my old mentor from undergrad preached, just make. Just make all the time. Make when you&amp;rsquo;re happy, make when you&amp;rsquo;re sad. Make the worst stuff you&amp;rsquo;ll ever make. Everything is a first draft, and no one has to see it. That&amp;rsquo;s why you make all the time, so you can take those first drafts and dress&amp;rsquo;em up a little as a second draft, then a third, then you got yourself a nice piece of writing. It&amp;rsquo;s good advice.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I&amp;rsquo;ve been compelled to write so much lately. I feel my piney-south georgian accent screaming to be heard and paid some mind. The idiolect I had adopted in Columbus was good, it served it&amp;rsquo;s purpose, and I expanded my vocabulary there more than I imagined. But at the same time I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m forsaking my mama, my nana, and my grandma by givin&amp;rsquo; up words like &amp;lsquo;buggy&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;fixin&amp;rsquo;, and phrases I&amp;rsquo;ve already sent to this virtual peice of paper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been in Connecticut for just over a week now. Settling in has definitely had its stressful moments, but  overall the move has been smooth. Our friends Ainsley and Gena arrived last Saturday to help us get the bulk of unpacking done. All four of us have moved within the last three months.&#xA;On Thursday we visited Wesleyan&amp;rsquo;s campus, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be working for the next eight or so months. Hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s a path for me to keep working there more long term, given I don&amp;rsquo;t get worn out by the hour-long commute in my &amp;lsquo;02 Tacoma each day. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the arts buildings spit brutalism in your face. A nice feature of the buildings is most a connected via an underground tunnel. Moreover, my supervisor, Kate, is super pleasant and excited to work with me just as much as I am her.&#xA;Before we know it, Joshua will be starting his classes. I know he&amp;rsquo;s excited, but he is even more excited to have a studio with lots and lots of studio time. His work lately has been insanely curious and wills me to study things I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered before. This new wave of interest he&amp;rsquo;s had is full of gumption and typical Joshua spirit, and it makes me oh so eager to see his upcoming journey.&#xA;Leaving Georgia was quite a tough decision, but every step of the way, not a single doubt took root. We both feel in our hearts that this was the best decision for us and we are both just content to be together in this new place. I told Joshua on Thursday, on the way back from Middletown, I was so scared I would feel a hole leaving our friends back in Georgia, but in fact I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the love we all have for each other is so strong, that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. The hole I was worried about is overflowing with love, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to fill it with more with new friends here in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A lot of gratitude for the experiences I&amp;rsquo;m earning. Eddie talked about &lt;i&gt;viberations&lt;/i&gt;, but that feels &lt;em&gt;too loud&lt;/em&gt;. Butch&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;intertwanglism&lt;/i&gt; is too culturally specific. Both were onto something though. When you begin to see it, you can&amp;rsquo;t unsee it. &lt;i&gt;The Egg&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;Universe&lt;/b&gt;, yada yada, yes- &lt;b&gt;BUT&lt;/b&gt;. Magic, spirits, living earth. There&amp;rsquo;s something &lt;em&gt;OUT THERE&lt;/EM&gt;. And yesterday I &lt;u&gt;felt&lt;/u&gt; it. Felt? Today I &lt;u&gt;SAW&lt;/u&gt; it. But looks and feels are quite different in this place. A visual version of the &lt;i&gt;Realm of Sonorous Being&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;what-is-all-of-this&#34;&gt;What is all of this?&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The snow made me very happy. I was elated we got to experience the park in this &amp;lsquo;&lt;i&gt;off season&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo; way.&#xA;Being is fun. Existing is rewarding.&#xA;All these questions make me happy.&#xA;The gratitude grows. I&amp;rsquo;m finding myself being grateful for the pain, fear, and anxiety as much as the awe, the love, and the pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the airport right now waiting for our first of two flights to get home. Yesterday we had a pretty easy day. With the winter advisory stil in effect for most of the parks, we didn&amp;rsquo;t feels safe going back for the last day. You could see the storms in the mountains from our accomodation. That morning, we made a big breakfast to try and use up as many groceries as we could.&#xA;With that, we took a day trip to Fresno. We explored a Japanese Garden that was located in a park. This garden was serene and full of flora from it&amp;rsquo;s namesake. We saw an exhibition of bonsai, some over 1000 years old, some koi, and a few peacocks and peahens.&#xA;Following the Japanese Garden we grabbed lunch and made our way to the Fresno Art Museum. They had a wonderful exhibit of uykio-e prints from the collection of the Georgia Museum of Art, go figure! They also had an exhibiton on trading cards, a secret war photographer, and Judy Wayne. Seem&amp;rsquo;s they have a thing for 2D work, more specifically printed work. The Wayne exhibition was especailly interesting with the use of negative imagry, lithography, and the type and color of paper she chose. The work was an exploration of her mother, a single working mom during the 40s and 50s, when that was unheard of. There I also spoke with two locals for quite some time who were very curious about what brought me to Fresno and what it&amp;rsquo;s like in Georgia. It was interesting to me that they think of Georgia as having a much higher crime rate than here in California.&#xA;Following the museum we visited another garden, Covis Botanical, which is all volunteer run. This garden was very nice, especially to be completely run by volunteers. I sat for a while under a tree and jotted down thoughts and images. We left there, stopped through a shopping center, then headed back for the evening. We spent the evening going through the mass of pictures we collected over the last five days.&#xA;A lot of happy pictures of happy people. We had a great time and made a lot of good memories together. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t have asked for a better trip with friends. Now I&amp;rsquo;m eager to visit more National Parks, we&amp;rsquo;ve got another trip planned in July for Congerie National Park. Maybe the Great Smokey Mountains is the thing to start planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The last few days have been so packed with experiences I can&amp;rsquo;t keep my head on straight. I reckon I&amp;rsquo;ll do things the Julie Andrews way and start from the very beginning.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;after-we-arrived-in-fresno-we-met-with-our-friends-and-got-our-car-for-dinner-we-had-in-n-out-which-for-most-of-us-was-our-first-time-the-way-they-chop-those-gigantic-potatoes-is-comical-and-hilarious-after-dinner-we-made-our-way-to-the-grocery-then-the-airbnb-and-crashed&#34;&gt;After we arrived in Fresno, we met with our friends and got our car. For dinner we had In-N-Out, which for most of us was our first time. The way they chop those gigantic potatoes is comical and hilarious. After dinner we made our way to the grocery then the AirBnb and crashed.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;the-next-morning-we-all-got-up-extra-early-for-our-long-drive-to-yosemite-national-park-we-got-to-see-most-of-the-big-hitters-el-capitan-the-half-dome-a-grove-of-giant-sequoias-meadows-and-waterfalls-we-got-so-wet-at-the-falls-everyone-was-grinning-like-a-dead-pig-and-had-the-giggles-at-the-yosemite-post-office-why-yes-there-is-a-post-office-in-the-park-i-got-my-notebook-stamped-with-the-special-note-they-have-for-mail-coming-out-of-the-park-the-drive-back-was-more-outrageous-than-the-drive-in-because-at-least-when-youre-driving-in-you-get-to-see-some-sights-at-night-its-pitch-black-in-them-hills&#34;&gt;The next morning we all got up extra early for our long drive to Yosemite National Park. We got to see most of the big hitters, El Capitan, the Half Dome, a grove of giant sequoias, meadows and waterfalls. We got so wet at the falls, everyone was grinning like a dead pig and had the giggles. At the Yosemite Post Office, why yes, there is a post office in the park, I got my notebook stamped with the special note they have for mail coming out of the park. The drive back was more outrageous than the drive in, because at least when you&amp;rsquo;re driving in, you get to see some sights. At night it&amp;rsquo;s pitch black in them hills.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;yesterday-we-made-our-way-to-sequoia-national-park-that-much-i-know-today-and-yesterday-are-kinda-running-together-for-me-because-were-getting-started-at-the-crack-of-dawn-and-crashing-at-11pm-we-went-through-the-foothills-of-the-park-and-saw-tunnel-rock-and-hospital-rock-then-made-our-way-up-to-higher-altitude-where-we-climbed-to-the-top-of-the-mountain-and-saw-some-really-neat-sequoias-we-hiked-back-down-so-we-could-then-visit-the-worlds-largest-tree-general-sherman-a-monument-to-say-the-least-however-we-were-all-quite-tired-at-that-point-and-had-some-more-places-in-mind-we-ended-the-day-by-watching-the-sunset-from-the-side-of-the-mountain-where-we-met-some-deer&#34;&gt;Yesterday we made our way to Sequoia National Park, that much I know. Today and yesterday are kinda running together for me because were getting started at the crack of dawn and crashing at 11PM. We went through the foothills of the park and saw Tunnel Rock and Hospital Rock then made our way up to higher altitude where we climbed to the top of the mountain and saw some really neat sequoias. We hiked back down so we could then visit the worlds largest tree, General Sherman. A monument to say the least, however we were all quite tired at that point and had some more places in mind. We ended the day by watching the sunset from the side of the mountain where we met some deer.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;today-we-fortunately-didnt-have-to-wait-on-a-road-closure-to-clear-up-for-us-to-get-into-the-main-area-of-sequoia-national-park-but-we-did-have-eminent-road-closures-due-to-a-winter-advisory-and-possible-snow-we-took-the-main-road-that-traverses-through-sequoia-and-into-formerly-known-as-grant-park-this-area-now-part-of-kings-canyon-has-another-one-of-the-largest-trees-in-the-world-the-second-to-be-more-specific-the-general-grant-tree-is-a-lot-more-impressive-in-my-opinion-than-the-sherman-tree-a-guide-explained-that-grant-grows-at-a-much-more-rapid-pace-than-sherman-so-if-all-goes-well-itll-be-the-largest-in-some-hundred-years-we-made-a-stop-on-the-way-out-of-kings-canyon-but-hustled-out-to-be-sure-the-road-didnt-close-on-us-lest-we-wanted-to-drive-out-around-our-elbow-to-get-to-our-ass-our-last-stop-was-tokopah-falls-the-hike-followed-marble-fork-of-kaweah-river-and-it-is-just-stunning-the-trail-is-likely-one-of-my-personal-favorites-as-we-approached-the-falls-it-slowly-began-to-snow-on-us-the-closer-we-got-the-more-it-snowed-we-made-it-right-up-to-a-great-view-of-the-falls-when-we-decided-to-turn-around-it-kept-snowing-it-kept-snowing-more-joshua-and-our-friends-were-getting-a-little-nervous-i-was-still-awestruck-beyond-worries-the-snow-was-beautiful-the-trees-were-beautiful-the-rapids-the-flurries-the-wet-soggy-soil-the-fog-the-clouds-the-wall-of-rock-scaling-your-whole-view-all-so-beautiful-we-made-it-back-safe-and-sound-no-tire-chains-needed-and-no-snow-on-the-roads&#34;&gt;Today we fortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait on a road closure to clear up for us to get into the main area of Sequoia National Park. But&amp;hellip; we did have eminent road closures due to a winter advisory and possible snow. We took the main road that traverses through Sequoia and into formerly known as Grant Park. This area, now part of Kings Canyon, has another one of the largest trees in the world, the second, to be more specific. The General Grant tree is a lot more impressive in my opinion than the Sherman tree. A guide explained that Grant grows at a much more rapid pace than Sherman, so if all goes well, it&amp;rsquo;ll be the largest in some hundred years. We made a stop on the way out of Kings Canyon, but hustled out to be sure the road didn&amp;rsquo;t close on us, lest we wanted to drive out around our elbow to get to our ass. Our last stop was Tokopah Falls. The hike followed Marble Fork of Kaweah River, and it is just stunning. The trail is likely one of my personal favorites. As we approached the falls, it slowly began to snow on us. The closer we got, the more it snowed. We made it right up to a great view of the falls, when we decided to turn around. It kept snowing. It kept snowing more. Joshua and our friends were getting a little nervous, I was still awestruck beyond worries. The snow was beautiful, the trees were beautiful, the rapids, the flurries, the wet soggy soil, the fog, the clouds, the wall of rock scaling your whole view. All so beautiful. We made it back safe and sound, no tire chains needed, and no snow on the roads.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;the-land-here-has-an-energy-that-is-hard-to-describe-with-words-its-serene-and-spiritual-monumental-and-cleansing-pure-and-sacred-theres-a-feeling-about-the-air-that-feels-like-a-spirit-of-some-kind-maybe-the-mountain-maybe-the-river-or-the-trees-its-hard-to-wrap-your-head-around-a-place-that-took-millions-of-years-to-develop-and-organisms-that-took-hundreds-or-even-thousands-of-years-to-grow-to-where-they-are-now-when-i-blink-i-see-flashes-of-the-seminal-landscape-that-we-were-so-fortunate-to-see-this-week-i-feel-overwhelmed-with-gratitude-in-this-moment-but-also-inspired-to-make-and-inspired-to-do-im-eager-to-see-what-come-of-this-experience&#34;&gt;The land here has an energy that is hard to describe with words. It&amp;rsquo;s serene and spiritual, monumental and cleansing, pure and sacred. There&amp;rsquo;s a feeling about the air that feels like a spirit of some kind, maybe the mountain, maybe the river, or the trees. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to wrap your head around a place that took millions of years to develop, and organisms that took hundreds, or even thousands of years to grow to where they are now. When I blink, I see flashes of the seminal landscape that we were so fortunate to see this week. I feel overwhelmed with gratitude in this moment but also inspired to make and inspired to do. I&amp;rsquo;m eager to see what come of this experience.&lt;/h6&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today the girlies and I are on the way out to California. Five of us are meeting in Fresno to drive out to an accommodation just between Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and the Giant Sequoias. We&amp;rsquo;re all super excited to experience these monuments together. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly special because these are some of our closest friends, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the last big things we get to do together while we all live in Georgia.&#xA;Joshua planned the whole thing, the way he does. I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful he&amp;rsquo;s headstrong about planning, because I am not. I want it all to just happen and enjoy the ride. He&amp;rsquo;s so excited for this trip; he&amp;rsquo;s bought binoculars, a harness, a new flashlight, new boots, jackets, the whole get-up. Of course, everything that can be is in the color green.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve packed a notebook I made especially for the month of May in addition to my regular sketchbook. I aim to take both out to the parks each day and have study time. I think I speak for most of us when I say we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; time to sit and draw and write. A professor of ours always says, &amp;ldquo;Writing is thinking.&amp;rdquo; Like most, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get the advice until I had sat with it and experienced it for myself. Writing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; thinking, but drawing is too. As visual artists, we all need the time to sketch ideas, jot notes, and study the world by translating it to paper.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll end with a poem I wrote for someone on the trip. Their birthday was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many are aware at this point, Joshua and I have made the decision to move to Connecticut. He&amp;rsquo;s enrolling in an MFA program at UCONN this fall. I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited for him, but also for myself. He&amp;rsquo;s needed space and time to make more now than ever. His feet are off the ground with interesting ideas and he seriously needs the facility and time to explore these ideas further. I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of him, he is becoming more of himself, and it makes me love him more and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
