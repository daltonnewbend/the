      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ebird.org/checklist/S293662529&#34;&gt;Napatree Point | US-RI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of the dune while scoping mergansers and eiders, I spotted a single goldeneye. I was a bit unsure of myself, but a few moments later over at the lighthouse I saw a dozen of them together on the water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ebird.org/checklist/S293662529&#34;&gt;Napatree Point | US-RI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Posted up on the sand dune that marks your &amp;rsquo;entrance&amp;rsquo; to Napatree Point, I scoped out hundreds of Red-brested Mergansers. Probably one of the most significant times I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them. I caught a glimpse of a very black duck with a bright orange bill. I was certain what I was looking at. I found it several times after my first spotting, but was unable to capture a photo.&#xA;Fortunately over at the lighthouse, I was able to see another and get a photo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Unsure what they were I snapped photos. Sent the video to a friend and she replied &amp;lsquo;Purple???&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I met her, she knew I had this power to go back in time with my camera. She&amp;rsquo;d let me have whatever I needed as long as when I went back, I photographed Sigrid. She wanted to see her long flowing dark brown hair and large brown eyes again. The woman was tending a field wearing a pair of overalls and a bandanna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I parked my truck, out of habit, in my old parking spot. I liked parking a little far away from my door back then just to get a little more exercise in. I walked in to greet Luke where it was cozy and dark. He mentioned something about the others showing up and asked why I parked so far away. There was a lot of snow on the ground, so it could have been dangerous to walk up hill like that. &amp;ldquo;I used to live here, you know?&amp;rdquo; Not in that very apartment, but down in 1007 for about a year, then I moved over to 1195. Luke was somewhere in between, and I had already forgotten. I knew the others would be here soon. The anticipation of swapping gifts was swimming in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There were a few moving through the field covering the old landfill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;for salt is the most important of seasonings. it makes our food taste like anything at all. without it, our meals boring and bland. it enriches all it touches, giving a dish life. when it rains, it pours. a pinch here, a teaspoon there. i&amp;rsquo;ve no measurable amount of gratitude for the salt you&amp;rsquo;ve enriched my life with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When they&amp;rsquo;d pull up to the mail box, she&amp;rsquo;d come running out from under the pool deck pretending to chase after something. Probably a squirrel. She somehow knew that dogs were supposed to keep guard of the house and keep rodents away. She took after her daddy, I think. Calm and gentle most of the time, but would get real serious when she needed to. You didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what she was thinking half the time because of how stoic she was.&#xA;I remember when we got them other dogs, she was not happy. She changed. She knew that they were suddenly more important than her. She kept more quiet most the time, but overall seemed more on edge. She especially didn&amp;rsquo;t like Parker, hardly anyone did. Emmie was fine most of the time, but she started actually killing rodents rather than just chasing them off. Their dad kept voicing concerns about them killing cats, or worse. Even Shelby started killing. She had never done nothing like that before. One time, back by the plum trees, there was something happening. All three of them were growling and making horrible noises, screeching, sounded like something from a horror movie. Once the folks got over there, they saw what was making that horrible noise and why. They&amp;rsquo;d gotten a raccoon.&#xA;Later that week it was just back to Shelby. The other dogs had posed too much a risk of rabies, and were a bad influence on her. They taught her how to get outside of the fence, had her killing animals, and overall just made her more on edge. She still wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same. Even more stoic than before, she lived quite quietly after they left. One thing she never forgot was how her Mama would pat the bench that squeaked so loud each time it was hit, she&amp;rsquo;d come from wherever she was and lay down on that bench. She was taught because in the middle of the night, she&amp;rsquo;d start barking at something beyond her fence. Probably an owl or something. So Mama would pat the bench and holler out, &amp;ldquo;Chellllll-burrrrrr,&amp;rdquo; to which she&amp;rsquo;d come running and lay down quietly and go to bed on that bench.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a kind of peace that comes in the autumn. The air smells clearer and feels crisp. Being swallowed up in a quilted duster made just for the wedding, and sipping good pour-over from my #1 DAD mug. Computer stuff is super interesting to me. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to learn how to use the computer as much as possible without picking up the mouse. Of course there&amp;rsquo;s things that still require it, but programs like Obsidian and Neovim make it easier. It&amp;rsquo;s really the browser that is the only thing that makes it hard. Oh and that music player. I need a different one, I think. I&amp;rsquo;m still going through the manual little by little to be sure I don&amp;rsquo;t miss anything. I&amp;rsquo;m eager to get to the configuration part where I can tell this system to open different apps based on the key bindings and somehow get rid of the bullshit I don&amp;rsquo;t want like AI and apps that aren&amp;rsquo;t so much for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you put the potatoes in the pot, just go ahead and turn it on high. You’re just boiling them, they ain’t gon’ burn. You need some salt and sometimes I’ll go ahead and throw in some pepper.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now you don’t have to sit here and watch it or play with it. Just let it boil for a while and come back to check on ‘em. You can tell they’re done when you stick a knife in and if it falls right back into the water.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;After they’re finished, pour off most the water and just start mashin’. Once they all are a little mashed, throw in your butter, some more black pepper, and just keep going ‘til they just as creamy as you like it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I don’t always fix gravy, usually only when I make pork chops or something like that. I pour a little broth in the pan to deglaze it, then I start puttin’ my flour in. Sometimes I’ll use cornstarch if that’s all I have, but whatchu don’t wanna do is use biscuit flour. That’ll make it taste too salty. I let the flour cook until it starts turning brown, then I add the rest of my broth or milk or whatever I’m usin’ that night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My heart&amp;rsquo;s been racing all morning. Will my makeup run, is my hair straightened, is there a uniform or dress code I don&amp;rsquo;t know about? I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a job job before. This place feels sterile and cold, unlike the Piggly Wiggly where I&amp;rsquo;m always seeing somebody I know.&#xA;My boss walked into the room with a big grin on her face, sayin&amp;rsquo; it&amp;rsquo;s good to see me. She asked if I believed any of that stuff about the computers all not working. I told her I didn&amp;rsquo;t know and I reckon we&amp;rsquo;d just have to see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I consider this encounter my first &amp;rsquo;life&amp;rsquo; encounter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Two-Thousand Eleven, I took a small vacation to Connecticut. Just north of New Haven there’s a wonderful pond with a bridge that cuts right through. Although there’s several houses and a hardware store, it’s surprisingly quiet. The water is marshy and there’s a skinny peninsula that runs parallel to the bridge that reminds me of the marshes back home in the Carolinas. The weather was perfect and cool. The heat wave was why I wanted to get out in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I remember my arrival caused quite the commotion last time, seemed I was some sort of celebrity to the folks around Connecticut. Wasn’t sure what I’d did or who I’d done but it was a full on paparazzi with their cameras and binoculars tryna get a good look at me any way they could. After a while it got old and I couldn’t relax anymore. I needed to be on my way back home and get some real sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the light turns on, everything within a two foot radius illuminates with a warm, candlelight color. The desk&amp;rsquo;s antique brown stain shimmers, the pages of the notebook turn caramel, and the wall tapestry marries forest green tones with light, reflecting it back onto the eyes of the artist. They&amp;rsquo;re taking notes about something, but you can&amp;rsquo;t make it out through the fog that is the dream. You catch a glimpse as they page through that there was a drawing of the very lamp they just flicked on. In their eyes, you can see concern, imagination, and lust.&#xA;A spruce hangs over you as you lean back against the bark. The air smells like autumn leaves, though you&amp;rsquo;re sure it&amp;rsquo;s the middle of winter. &amp;lsquo;Chewink-chewink&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo;too-wink, too-wink&amp;rsquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a towhee.&#xA;The leather of the boots shows its age, the uppers being covered by jeans or another work pant are soft, still with some shine. The toes are worn near-bare to the steel underneath. Mudding around in the soil with your feet, you can feel there&amp;rsquo;s something hard just below the surface. A root of the spruce. Burgeoning from the bark are little branches you pluck off to grow saplings. These trees will build you a fine home someday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since yesterday, I&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to explain what it is I mean to say. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying things that I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to say at all. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean yesterday, I mean&amp;rsquo;t sometime in the last five days. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly how this is happening. If I&amp;rsquo;ve come down with an illness of some kind, giving me brain fog, or if I should consider cutting back on coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>parker house rolls cafe</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thepapers.newbend.art/fictionaries/parker-house-rolls-cafe/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d head there every other Sunday right after church. It seemed like it was one of Don&amp;rsquo;s favorites as much as it was my grandsons. They both liked something about circling what they wanted on the menu and handing it off to the waitress. They handed you a card and a golf pencil, now that might be another reason Don liked it so much, sat you down and fixed you a sweet tea with lemon or whatever else you wanted to drink. First section on the card was about bread. Did you want their famous parker house rolls, or did you want cloverleaf rolls? I never wanted to make Mama mad, and to tell you the truth, I didn&amp;rsquo;t much care for the crunchier crust on cloverleaf anyway. Usually the waitress would peak at what you had circled in the bread section before you finished so they could get it on the table faster. Next you picked your meat or if you were just go&amp;rsquo;n have sides. My grandson always gets the cubed steak or the pork ribs. Me and Don both picked whatever chicken they had, usually. You pick your vegetables, two if you got a meat, three if you didn&amp;rsquo;t. And last, you&amp;rsquo;d pick which dessert you were go&amp;rsquo;n have. The best week was also the worst, because you&amp;rsquo;d want all of them: mud pie, pecan pie, or key lime pie.&#xA;Being it a small town, we always managed to run into folks we knew from church or somewhere else around the community. Don could talk to just about anybody, and he would do just that. He would just talk, and I mean talk, and talk, and talk, and talk. You&amp;rsquo;d think he was just about done and he&amp;rsquo;s start talking again, about some other sorry fella he knew and what ailed them. He would go on so long, and in such detail, folks would think they were being rude to the man by excusing themselves. It never bothered him. He was understanding and knew he had more than enough to say.&#xA;Now back on these rolls, they were the softest parker rolls you&amp;rsquo;d ever have and had plenty of butter too. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they put a slice of butter in the middle before they fold them over and put them in the oven. When me an Mama made them, ours are always the slightest bit crispy. The ones at the cafe were just like a sponge. Well, a sponge that if you squished it, it&amp;rsquo;d stay that way and you&amp;rsquo;d have a hard ball of dough again. I wonder what it was they used to put in them rolls that made them so soft like that. It might just be that when you make something yourself, you can see all its flaws all the more clearly. When you&amp;rsquo;re making food for eight, ten, or even the fellowship, you notice when your rolls aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly the way you&amp;rsquo;d want them to be, even if all of them were gone before the cakes were even touched.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The little house sparrows keep oscillating from the bush out front to the ledge of the roof. Occasionally their wings all flutter at the same moment resulting in a sound that almost resembles sudden rainfall.&#xA;The coffee was pretty good this morning, I quite like the one I got from the local co-op.&#xA;&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;&#xA;It sure is busy this morning.&#xA;I spoke with Ainsley on Facetime for what started out as a conversation about hollandaise sauce. I haven&amp;rsquo;t got a clue how to make it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve substituted with a mixture of mayonnaise, mustard, and vinegar a few times. We chatted about plants, settling into our new spaces and places. I was reminded about the similarities here with home, but also the differences.&#xA;Its neat how close these birds are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ebird.org/checklist/S194626513&#34;&gt;Wesleyan University - CFA Lawn | US-CT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is kind-of the bird that started it all. I heard birds calling on campus, quite a lot actually. All different kinds of calls too. I was wondering what they were- or even where they were for that matter. On the way to work one day, I asked my commuting buddy, John, if he knew what they could be. He told me to download Merlin and see for myself. I fired it up once I got to work and it turned out every last one of them were Blue Jays. All of them. I, at the time, had no idea the vastness of most bird&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary. I thought it was just Mockingbirds that could make all those different calls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>a cool late-summer morning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a cool late-summer morning, a sunday, and I&amp;rsquo;m sipping on my coffee that tastes like Columbus, Georgia. Having the windows open first thing in the morning is quite a treat, and I sadly anticipate the time of year this won&amp;rsquo;t be available.&#xA;Each morning I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to start the day off with mindfulness and body awareness. A breif meditation session followed by a radio taiso routine, sometimes I throw in some extra hamstring stretches at the end. This morning, I felt compelled to right for a bit before me and my new neighbor and friend, Annie, go for a run. It&amp;rsquo;s been nagging at be all year, this compulsion to write. The compulsion to read has be gnawing at my left ear just as much. Having treated myself to this new computer with this thocky keyboard, writing is just like eating a boston cream donut at the Brimfield Flea Market. That donut yesterday was something special. I&amp;rsquo;ve never in my life had a boston cream that rendered me speechless.&#xA;Joshua being in grad school means he&amp;rsquo;s got a lot to read, and one of those things is Bird by Bird by Anne Larmotte. She&amp;rsquo;s a writer, obviously, but also a writing coach. Bird by Bird is Lamotte&amp;rsquo;s advice column of a paperback on how to be a better, and more fulfilled writer. Her advice is exactly what my old mentor from undergrad preached, just make. Just make all the time. Make when you&amp;rsquo;re happy, make when you&amp;rsquo;re sad. Make the worst stuff you&amp;rsquo;ll ever make. Everything is a first draft, and no one has to see it. That&amp;rsquo;s why you make all the time, so you can take those first drafts and dress&amp;rsquo;em up a little as a second draft, then a third, then you got yourself a nice piece of writing. It&amp;rsquo;s good advice.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I&amp;rsquo;ve been compelled to write so much lately. I feel my piney-south georgian accent screaming to be heard and paid some mind. The idiolect I had adopted in Columbus was good, it served it&amp;rsquo;s purpose, and I expanded my vocabulary there more than I imagined. But at the same time I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m forsaking my mama, my nana, and my grandma by givin&amp;rsquo; up words like &amp;lsquo;buggy&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;fixin&amp;rsquo;, and phrases I&amp;rsquo;ve already sent to this virtual peice of paper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been in Connecticut for just over a week now. Settling in has definitely had its stressful moments, but  overall the move has been smooth. Our friends Ainsley and Gena arrived last Saturday to help us get the bulk of unpacking done. All four of us have moved within the last three months.&#xA;On Thursday we visited Wesleyan&amp;rsquo;s campus, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be working for the next eight or so months. Hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s a path for me to keep working there more long term, given I don&amp;rsquo;t get worn out by the hour-long commute in my &amp;lsquo;02 Tacoma each day. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the arts buildings spit brutalism in your face. A nice feature of the buildings is most a connected via an underground tunnel. Moreover, my supervisor, Kate, is super pleasant and excited to work with me just as much as I am her.&#xA;Before we know it, Joshua will be starting his classes. I know he&amp;rsquo;s excited, but he is even more excited to have a studio with lots and lots of studio time. His work lately has been insanely curious and wills me to study things I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered before. This new wave of interest he&amp;rsquo;s had is full of gumption and typical Joshua spirit, and it makes me oh so eager to see his upcoming journey.&#xA;Leaving Georgia was quite a tough decision, but every step of the way, not a single doubt took root. We both feel in our hearts that this was the best decision for us and we are both just content to be together in this new place. I told Joshua on Thursday, on the way back from Middletown, I was so scared I would feel a hole leaving our friends back in Georgia, but in fact I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the love we all have for each other is so strong, that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. The hole I was worried about is overflowing with love, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to fill it with more with new friends here in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A lot of gratitude for the experiences I&amp;rsquo;m earning. Eddie talked about &lt;i&gt;viberations&lt;/i&gt;, but that feels &lt;em&gt;too loud&lt;/em&gt;. Butch&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;intertwanglism&lt;/i&gt; is too culturally specific. Both were onto something though. When you begin to see it, you can&amp;rsquo;t unsee it. &lt;i&gt;The Egg&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;Universe&lt;/b&gt;, yada yada, yes- &lt;b&gt;BUT&lt;/b&gt;. Magic, spirits, living earth. There&amp;rsquo;s something &lt;em&gt;OUT THERE&lt;/EM&gt;. And yesterday I &lt;u&gt;felt&lt;/u&gt; it. Felt? Today I &lt;u&gt;SAW&lt;/u&gt; it. But looks and feels are quite different in this place. A visual version of the &lt;i&gt;Realm of Sonorous Being&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;what-is-all-of-this&#34;&gt;What is all of this?&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The snow made me very happy. I was elated we got to experience the park in this &amp;lsquo;&lt;i&gt;off season&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo; way.&#xA;Being is fun. Existing is rewarding.&#xA;All these questions make me happy.&#xA;The gratitude grows. I&amp;rsquo;m finding myself being grateful for the pain, fear, and anxiety as much as the awe, the love, and the pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the airport right now waiting for our first of two flights to get home. Yesterday we had a pretty easy day. With the winter advisory stil in effect for most of the parks, we didn&amp;rsquo;t feels safe going back for the last day. You could see the storms in the mountains from our accomodation. That morning, we made a big breakfast to try and use up as many groceries as we could.&#xA;With that, we took a day trip to Fresno. We explored a Japanese Garden that was located in a park. This garden was serene and full of flora from it&amp;rsquo;s namesake. We saw an exhibition of bonsai, some over 1000 years old, some koi, and a few peacocks and peahens.&#xA;Following the Japanese Garden we grabbed lunch and made our way to the Fresno Art Museum. They had a wonderful exhibit of uykio-e prints from the collection of the Georgia Museum of Art, go figure! They also had an exhibiton on trading cards, a secret war photographer, and Judy Wayne. Seem&amp;rsquo;s they have a thing for 2D work, more specifically printed work. The Wayne exhibition was especailly interesting with the use of negative imagry, lithography, and the type and color of paper she chose. The work was an exploration of her mother, a single working mom during the 40s and 50s, when that was unheard of. There I also spoke with two locals for quite some time who were very curious about what brought me to Fresno and what it&amp;rsquo;s like in Georgia. It was interesting to me that they think of Georgia as having a much higher crime rate than here in California.&#xA;Following the museum we visited another garden, Covis Botanical, which is all volunteer run. This garden was very nice, especially to be completely run by volunteers. I sat for a while under a tree and jotted down thoughts and images. We left there, stopped through a shopping center, then headed back for the evening. We spent the evening going through the mass of pictures we collected over the last five days.&#xA;A lot of happy pictures of happy people. We had a great time and made a lot of good memories together. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t have asked for a better trip with friends. Now I&amp;rsquo;m eager to visit more National Parks, we&amp;rsquo;ve got another trip planned in July for Congerie National Park. Maybe the Great Smokey Mountains is the thing to start planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For dinner we had In-N-Out, which for most of us was our first time. The way they chop those gigantic potatoes is comical and hilarious.

We got to see most of the big hitters, El Capitan, the Half Dome, a grove of giant sequoias, meadows and waterfalls. We got so wet at the falls, everyone was grinning like a dead pig and had the giggles. At the Yosemite Post Office, why yes, there is a post office in the park, I got my notebook stamped with the special note they have for mail coming out of the park. The drive back was more outrageous than the drive in, because at least when you&amp;rsquo;re driving in, you get to see some sights. At night it&amp;rsquo;s pitch black in them hills.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;yesterday-we-made-our-way-to-sequoia-national-park-that-much-i-know-today-and-yesterday-are-kinda-running-together-for-me-because-were-getting-started-at-the-crack-of-dawn-and-crashing-at-11pm-we-went-through-the-foothills-of-the-park-and-saw-tunnel-rock-and-hospital-rock-then-made-our-way-up-to-higher-altitude-where-we-climbed-to-the-top-of-the-mountain-and-saw-some-really-neat-sequoias-we-hiked-back-down-so-we-could-then-visit-the-worlds-largest-tree-general-sherman-a-monument-to-say-the-least-however-we-were-all-quite-tired-at-that-point-and-had-some-more-places-in-mind-we-ended-the-day-by-watching-the-sunset-from-the-side-of-the-mountain-where-we-met-some-deer&#34;&gt;Yesterday we made our way to Sequoia National Park, that much I know. Today and yesterday are kinda running together for me because were getting started at the crack of dawn and crashing at 11PM. We went through the foothills of the park and saw Tunnel Rock and Hospital Rock then made our way up to higher altitude where we climbed to the top of the mountain and saw some really neat sequoias. We hiked back down so we could then visit the worlds largest tree, General Sherman. A monument to say the least, however we were all quite tired at that point and had some more places in mind. We ended the day by watching the sunset from the side of the mountain where we met some deer.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;today-we-fortunately-didnt-have-to-wait-on-a-road-closure-to-clear-up-for-us-to-get-into-the-main-area-of-sequoia-national-park-but-we-did-have-eminent-road-closures-due-to-a-winter-advisory-and-possible-snow-we-took-the-main-road-that-traverses-through-sequoia-and-into-formerly-known-as-grant-park-this-area-now-part-of-kings-canyon-has-another-one-of-the-largest-trees-in-the-world-the-second-to-be-more-specific-the-general-grant-tree-is-a-lot-more-impressive-in-my-opinion-than-the-sherman-tree-a-guide-explained-that-grant-grows-at-a-much-more-rapid-pace-than-sherman-so-if-all-goes-well-itll-be-the-largest-in-some-hundred-years-we-made-a-stop-on-the-way-out-of-kings-canyon-but-hustled-out-to-be-sure-the-road-didnt-close-on-us-lest-we-wanted-to-drive-out-around-our-elbow-to-get-to-our-ass-our-last-stop-was-tokopah-falls-the-hike-followed-marble-fork-of-kaweah-river-and-it-is-just-stunning-the-trail-is-likely-one-of-my-personal-favorites-as-we-approached-the-falls-it-slowly-began-to-snow-on-us-the-closer-we-got-the-more-it-snowed-we-made-it-right-up-to-a-great-view-of-the-falls-when-we-decided-to-turn-around-it-kept-snowing-it-kept-snowing-more-joshua-and-our-friends-were-getting-a-little-nervous-i-was-still-awestruck-beyond-worries-the-snow-was-beautiful-the-trees-were-beautiful-the-rapids-the-flurries-the-wet-soggy-soil-the-fog-the-clouds-the-wall-of-rock-scaling-your-whole-view-all-so-beautiful-we-made-it-back-safe-and-sound-no-tire-chains-needed-and-no-snow-on-the-roads&#34;&gt;Today we fortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait on a road closure to clear up for us to get into the main area of Sequoia National Park. But&amp;hellip; we did have eminent road closures due to a winter advisory and possible snow. We took the main road that traverses through Sequoia and into formerly known as Grant Park. This area, now part of Kings Canyon, has another one of the largest trees in the world, the second, to be more specific. The General Grant tree is a lot more impressive in my opinion than the Sherman tree. A guide explained that Grant grows at a much more rapid pace than Sherman, so if all goes well, it&amp;rsquo;ll be the largest in some hundred years. We made a stop on the way out of Kings Canyon, but hustled out to be sure the road didn&amp;rsquo;t close on us, lest we wanted to drive out around our elbow to get to our ass. Our last stop was Tokopah Falls. The hike followed Marble Fork of Kaweah River, and it is just stunning. The trail is likely one of my personal favorites. As we approached the falls, it slowly began to snow on us. The closer we got, the more it snowed. We made it right up to a great view of the falls, when we decided to turn around. It kept snowing. It kept snowing more. Joshua and our friends were getting a little nervous, I was still awestruck beyond worries. The snow was beautiful, the trees were beautiful, the rapids, the flurries, the wet soggy soil, the fog, the clouds, the wall of rock scaling your whole view. All so beautiful. We made it back safe and sound, no tire chains needed, and no snow on the roads.&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;the-land-here-has-an-energy-that-is-hard-to-describe-with-words-its-serene-and-spiritual-monumental-and-cleansing-pure-and-sacred-theres-a-feeling-about-the-air-that-feels-like-a-spirit-of-some-kind-maybe-the-mountain-maybe-the-river-or-the-trees-its-hard-to-wrap-your-head-around-a-place-that-took-millions-of-years-to-develop-and-organisms-that-took-hundreds-or-even-thousands-of-years-to-grow-to-where-they-are-now-when-i-blink-i-see-flashes-of-the-seminal-landscape-that-we-were-so-fortunate-to-see-this-week-i-feel-overwhelmed-with-gratitude-in-this-moment-but-also-inspired-to-make-and-inspired-to-do-im-eager-to-see-what-come-of-this-experience&#34;&gt;The land here has an energy that is hard to describe with words. It&amp;rsquo;s serene and spiritual, monumental and cleansing, pure and sacred. There&amp;rsquo;s a feeling about the air that feels like a spirit of some kind, maybe the mountain, maybe the river, or the trees. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to wrap your head around a place that took millions of years to develop, and organisms that took hundreds, or even thousands of years to grow to where they are now. When I blink, I see flashes of the seminal landscape that we were so fortunate to see this week. I feel overwhelmed with gratitude in this moment but also inspired to make and inspired to do. I&amp;rsquo;m eager to see what come of this experience.&lt;/h6&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today the girlies and I are on the way out to California. Five of us are meeting in Fresno to drive out to an accommodation just between Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and the Giant Sequoias. We&amp;rsquo;re all super excited to experience these monuments together. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly special because these are some of our closest friends, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the last big things we get to do together while we all live in Georgia.&#xA;Joshua planned the whole thing, the way he does. I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful he&amp;rsquo;s headstrong about planning, because I am not. I want it all to just happen and enjoy the ride. He&amp;rsquo;s so excited for this trip; he&amp;rsquo;s bought binoculars, a harness, a new flashlight, new boots, jackets, the whole get-up. Of course, everything that can be is in the color green.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve packed a notebook I made especially for the month of May in addition to my regular sketchbook. I aim to take both out to the parks each day and have study time. I think I speak for most of us when I say we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; time to sit and draw and write. A professor of ours always says, &amp;ldquo;Writing is thinking.&amp;rdquo; Like most, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get the advice until I had sat with it and experienced it for myself. Writing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; thinking, but drawing is too. As visual artists, we all need the time to sketch ideas, jot notes, and study the world by translating it to paper.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll end with a poem I wrote for someone on the trip. Their birthday was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many are aware at this point, Joshua and I have made the decision to move to Connecticut. He&amp;rsquo;s enrolling in an MFA program at UCONN this fall. I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited for him, but also for myself. He&amp;rsquo;s needed space and time to make more now than ever. His feet are off the ground with interesting ideas and he seriously needs the facility and time to explore these ideas further. I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of him, he is becoming more of himself, and it makes me love him more and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ebird.org/checklist/S206544728&#34;&gt;Mildred&amp;rsquo;s Lane | US-PA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|||||||&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; My first &amp;rsquo;encounter&amp;rsquo; was an  audio recording at Mildred&amp;rsquo;s Lane, although I remember in 2020 having a conversation with my roommate at the time, Jaylon, which were called Robins and which were Cardinals. I believe he and I kept changing our minds during the conversation, so at some point, we both had thought Cardnials as Robins.&#xA;This whole conversation came about because there were dozens in our back yard feeding on the mullberries that had fallen from the tree that autumn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I recorded lots of birdsong for a project on [[tesselates]] I was working on. These pigeons were common in gardens we visited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I later re-encountered this bird on a trip to the UK to visit my friend, Racheal, where it was heard throughout the country, also common for gardens and wildlife areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had forgotten about this bird until fall of 2024 when I went through my media of birds. Before becoming a birder, I would often document birds with the intention of figuring out what they were at a later date. Seven years later, I rediscovered the video and the memory crept back into consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These guys are abundant, and I&amp;rsquo;m always glad to see them. Another great sighting was at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebird.org/checklist/S286795928&#34;&gt;Farmington Meadows&lt;/a&gt; when hundreds began flying in from the distance which created these faint black lines in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
